# crickett_connect

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is has some aspects completed and others still in the works.

This project has: 
 1. Google sign in verification through FireBase.
 2. Chatbot through Flask server connection.
 3. History tracker.
 4. New User Registeration.


The project will be a functional cricket application where users can ask the chatbot cricket related querie (this is completed) and can see videos on how to improve (coming soon) and live scores (coming soon). I am working on currently finding an live scores API to integrate inside of my app.
